# MeetingAI
## Make meetings simple

MeetingAI is a slack app that helps you book outlook meetings for your organization directly from slack. Simple tell MAI where you would like to meet, with whom, and what time. A modal will be generated based on your request and an option to submit will appear. Once submitted, all members that were added to the invite will receive an outlook calendar invite.

This is still a work in progress.
